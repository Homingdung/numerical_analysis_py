# numerical_analysis_py

## Introduction 
I choose to upload the python file for my CW in year 2, which including some main numerical methods for mathematical problems, like root-finding problem, linear system, interpolation, derivative of interpolation and ODE solver. 

Additionaly, I add two interesting problems from physics, ```orbitCalculatro.py``` and ```trinityExplosion.py```.

## Background 
G. I. Taylor studied the movie of the Trinity test explosion, estimating the yield of the bomb. The method he used is what we called dimension analysis.

Dimensions of some physical variables:
